A valid model, in the context of the information provided, means a model that meets certain criteria for statistical significance and positive coefficients for all channels. Specifically, the model must have at least 80% of the variables exhibit statistical significance, and all coefficients of the channels must be positive. This ensures that the model is reliable and accurate for further analysis.\n",
